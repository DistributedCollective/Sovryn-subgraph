# Candlesticks

"""
Candlesticks are for presentational purposes on the dapp. This entity supports the candlestick trading data on the trading view charts.
Trading data is available for the following pairs:
1. All tokens to RBTC
2. All tokens to XUSD
There is not candlestick data for other trading pairs as this would cause the amount of data stored to increase exponentially
"""

  The ID is fromToken + toToken + timestamp + interval
  toToken will be either RBTC or XUSD
  interval is a CandleSticksInterval (see interval data type below)

  Prices shown are the price of the base token in the quote token (eg price of SOV in XUSD)
