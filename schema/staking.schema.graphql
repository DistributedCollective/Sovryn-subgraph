This is an event emitted from the staking contract when tokens are staked, either by a user or by a vesting contract
If tokens are staked by a vesting contract, there may be multiple tokens staked event per transaction (eg if tokensa are vested over 10 months, there would be 10 TokensStaked events each with a different lockedUntil date)
We have improvements planned to better represent staking on our subgraph.
